*Welcome To my 4th homework project*

Index.html:
For this project I began by setting up a basic layout for all the necessary components on the html, this inlcudes the time, highscore button, start button, and welcome message. I used classes to do basic styling and make responsiveness easier to code. After finishing my stylesheet and script files I had to return to the index to do some debugging and ensure each piece was functioning as intended, as well as appealing to the eye.

Style.css:
With the style sheet I started with setting up styling for all the major elements of the page like the questions, answers, and various buttons. This is where I chose the overall color scheme and font styling. I found myself returniing to this file numerous times throughout the project in order to get the positioning of various elements as they appaeared or changed to be as desired. Eventually mostly everything was settled where desired.

Script.js/Assets.js:
These files contain most the functionality of the page and were the most difficukt to work with by far. I began by setting up all the necessary variables I would need throughout the file. Next moving to functions that would be accessed while still at the starting page, such as the highscore button. After that I began coding necessary functions as they came to mind. This started with the timer and submit functions and then the quiz functions. These would populate the page with the next question, as well as take away time if the answer were wrong. Last was the timeout function if the time happened to reach 0.
